Eskrimador is meant to be a tactical, gritty, and survival focused roleplaying game.

See [[Eskrimador Notes\|Eskrimador Notes]] for other notes.

# Core Mechanics

- Characters go from 0 to 20 levels with an additional 10 levels for a prestige system.
- Everything uses: d20 + Skill + Attribute - Degradation Die ≥ 10
#### Degradation Dice
Degradation Dice are meant to create pressure and are modifiers for different states of health.

**Fresh (0) → Worn (d4) → Damaged (d6) → Broken (d8) → Ruined (d10) → Destroyed (Loss of Function)**

#### Initiative
Initiative is not rolled and instead the players always go first unless the opponent have [[Traits\|Traits]] that allow them to supersede players in the initiative order.
