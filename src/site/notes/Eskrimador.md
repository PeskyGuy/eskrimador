# Eskrimador
Eskrimador is meant to be a tactical, gritty, and survival focused roleplaying game.

See [[Eskrimador Notes\|Eskrimador Notes]] for other notes.
## Core Mechanics

- Characters go from 0 to 20 levels with an additional 10 levels for a prestige system.
- Everything uses: d20 + Skill + Attribute - Degradation Die ≥ 10

#### Degradation
Degradation is meant to create pressure and are modifiers for different states of health.

**Fresh (0) → Worn (-1) → Damaged (-2) → Broken (-3) → Ruined (-4) → Destroyed

#### Initiative
Initiative is not rolled and instead the players always go first unless the opponent have [[Traits\|Traits]] that allow them to supersede players in the initiative order.

#### Combat
The core attributes of combat are: Evasion and Armor. The first is a representation of your agility in combat and how well you can dodge attacks, if an enemy rolls equal or over your Evasion, the attack hits. Armor is a value that deducts the damage dealt to you.
